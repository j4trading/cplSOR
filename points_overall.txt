Talk with Scott:
These are the ways that we can use to get files to open in Excel:
 
One is a script that he has called t2txlr …or something like that…it’s a bash script
 
There are also python libraries that you can use and they are very easy.
 
Finally to solve the problem of having to have formatting…he has a ready made google docs that he copies to.
After copying the file to goode docs…which is easy to do with the google docs api then e he copies or converts the fiel into a excel document….thus taking the formatting that it acquired in the google docs.
 
These are the libraries that are already installed on the linux machine:
 
Python:
import xlrd
 
R:
xlsx
